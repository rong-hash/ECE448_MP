## Section I: Algorithms (Search)

In this section, we describe the algorithms and data structures used for implementing four search strategies: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Greedy Best-First Search (Greedy BFS), and A* Search.

### State and Node Representation

- **State:** 
- **Node:** 

### Differences Between State and Node

- Discuss the distinction between a state and a node in your implementations.

### Frontier Management

- Describe the data structure(s) used to manage the frontier in each search strategy.
- Explain any specific choices for data structures (e.g., stack, queue, priority queue) and their impact on the algorithm's performance.

### Explored States List

- Detail how you maintain an explored states list, if applicable.
- Explain the mechanism for detecting and managing repeated states.

## Section II: Algorithms (A* and Greedy BFS)

This section focuses on the heuristic(s) used for A* and Greedy BFS, particularly for single-dot and multiple-dot scenarios.

### Heuristics Description

- **Single Dot Scenario:** Describe the heuristic(s) used and justify their selection.
- **Multiple Dot Scenario:** Explain how the heuristic(s) are adapted or developed for handling multiple goals.

### Admissibility of Heuristics

- Provide proof or a strong argument for the admissibility of the heuristics used in A*.
